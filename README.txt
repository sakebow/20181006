This is a project about student management system using aspMVC frame
software: VS2015 - Enterpriter
          SQL Server 2014 - Professional
          Aliyun Server(running SQL Server)

WARING:
1 - I build up my database on Aliyun Server, which cost 9.9 RMB each month. If you would like to use you local database, just create a new database and run my sql scripts in "sql" folder
2 - Do not create CSS files including "div", "img" and other keywords, that will absolutely lead to unexpected results. Many elements in "_Layout.cshtml" file will be ruined
