This is a project about student management system using aspMVC frame
software: VS2015 - Enterpriter
          SQL Server 2014 - Professional
          Aliyun Server(running SQL Server)

WARING:
1 - I build up my database on Aliyun Server, which cost 9.9 RMB each month. If you would like to use you local database, just create a new database and run my sql scripts in "sql" folder
2 - Do not create CSS files including "div", "img" and other keywords, that will absolutely lead to unexpected results. Many elements in "_Layout.cshtml" file will be ruined

UPDATED on Oct.7th, 2018:
We give up this project.
There's some deadly mistake in our database.
So, we have to make a brand new one to replace this.
But we will never live it up to you because this is college homework,
which means we have to make it before deadline.
Please wait...
However, if your requirement doesn't as serious as ours, you can just use it and update it.
Have fun!

UPDATED on NOV.15th, 2018:
This is our 4th version.
No more damned expections.
We just try our best to do what we can do.
And we should speed up otherwise our team will be darned.
