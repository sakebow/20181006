-- GENERAL
In this folder, there're two sql scripts

-- WHAT'S IN EACH FILE?
All tables, primary keys, foreign keys, along with check and default are defined in "finaltest".
While there's something more might be in need in "addonsDB".

-- HOW TO USE IT?
If you haven't build up your database, just run "finaltest.sql" in your SQL Server.
Although many details haven't completed yet, they are still enough for a student management system.

-- SOMETHING WORTH METHONING
All tables and fields are defined in Chinese. 
You can change thenm into English or any language else as you like
Some of all the fields are useless, you can delete them to fit your requirement
