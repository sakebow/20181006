sql scripts for new version have been uploaded.
All tables and fields are defined in Chinese, too.
Here're changes in new version:
 * 1. field "married" is defined in a single table, because now we have six different sex, including "男", "女", "男转女", "女转男", "男女同体", "未鉴定" in Chinese. Isn't it amazing?
      Before we can just define field "sex" like this:
------------------------------------------------------------------
      CREATE TABLE student(
          sex  char(6)  not null,
      );
      ALTER TABLE student ADD CONSTRAINT ck_student_sex CHECK(sex in ("male", "female"));
------------------------------------------------------------------
      But now everything is different.
      I 'm now not sure how the field will be, so each one like "sex" are defined in a single table for further updated, otherwise I will spend long time to create a new one, which is quite annoying.

 * 2. There're more views.
      In Version1, start a project will pay you a lot time to wait, even up to 10 seconds. That's really a lot time. So I think if it's better to have more views?
      Last winter vacation I joined a project. That time our team ignored the usage of views. We didn't set "class" in teacher table but in student table. Thus forcing us to search across the database when showing teachers' data when opening web pages. When presenting our project, we spend every 10 seconds to show every page of data. That's damn slow for a management system.

Version 4 come out now.
My teacher said all early version were so messy that he would never like to make comments on my scripts after reading one tenth of my scripts.
After my teacher told me a lot of the basics of database, I suddenly realized my faults.
So, here's my th version.
Hoping things will be better.
